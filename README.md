# Online Pizza Ordering Store - Individual Project
<br />
Problem Statement:
Katie’s Pizza Store came to me with a problem that she needed help setting
up a system to deliver a database with a user interface where customers can
successfully order pizza online that the pizza store employees can access.
Katie’s Pizza Store wants to increase sales by implementing this form of
ordering and allow the customers to work more efficiently and quickly with
the system. The customers need to be able to order pizza successfully from
the system while collecting personal information, payment, and order
information. The store employees need to be able to successfully receive the
orders among other helpful tasks such as changing and tracing the order
status and having access to view a customer’s information for verification.

Proposal:
We propose a user-friendly software system to allow the customers to
successfully create and edit a customer account to order pizzas online, trace
the status of an order, and view their order history. The software system will
also allow the employees of the pizza store to successfully receive new
orders, trace the status of an order, and search a customer’s profile in the
software system.

System Description:
The system includes two subsystems: an online ordering subsystem and an
order management subsystem. The online ordering subsystem allows
customers to order pizzas online. The orders shall be kept in a database.
The staffs of the store can then handle the orders with the order
management subsystems. The status of an order should be kept in the
database. The customers should be able to trace their orders online. Other
considerations are welcome.
